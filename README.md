# mie-py
Mie scattering calculations as described in Bohren and Huffman (1). 
Python code is based on a fortran to python translation conduced by Herbert Kaiser. Last time I checked the link to 
[the original code](http://scatterlib.googlecode.com/files/bhmie_herbert_kaiser_july2012.py) was broken.
